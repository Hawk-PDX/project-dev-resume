1. **Projects** - Add, edit, delete, and reorder projects
2. **Certificates** - View existing certificates (read-only in current implementation)
3. **Skills** - Static display (managed via backend routes)
4. **Experience & Education** - Static display (managed via backend routes or database seeding)

## üìú Managing Other Content

### Certificates

**Current Status**: Read-only display
- Certificates are shown in the Certificates section
- To add/edit certificates, you need to:
  1. Use the backend API directly, or

  3. Use a database admin tool

### Skills

**Current Status**: Static display managed in backend routes
- Skills are categorized into: Frontend, Backend, Database, Tools
- Each skill has a proficiency level (1-5)
- To modify skills:
  1. Edit `backend/app/routes/skills.py` fallback data, or
  2. Add to database via seeding script

### Experience & Education

**Current Status**: Static display from backend routes
- Shows work experience and educational background
- To modify:
  1. Edit the fallback data in `backend/app/routes/resume.py`, or

## üéõÔ∏è Admin Interface Tips

### Form Validation
- **Title is required** for projects
- **URL fields** validate proper URL format
- **Order Priority** accepts numbers only

### Visual Feedback
- **Success messages** appear in green when operations succeed
- **Error messages** appear in red if something goes wrong
- **Loading states** show "Adding Project..." / "Updating Project..." during saves

### Best Practices

**Project Management:**
- Use **descriptive titles** that clearly identify your projects
- Keep **descriptions concise** but informative (1-2 sentences)
- List **key technologies** used, separated by commas
- Use **order priority** to highlight your best work (higher numbers = top placement)
- Mark your **best projects as featured**

**URL Guidelines:**
- **GitHub URLs** should link to the actual repository
- **Live Demo URLs** should point to working deployments
- **Image URLs** should be publicly accessible (consider using GitHub raw URLs or image hosting)

**Organization:**
- **Regular cleanup** - Remove outdated projects periodically  
- **Keep current** - Update project descriptions and technologies as you enhance them
- **Quality over quantity** - Feature your best 4-6 projects rather than everything

## üîß Troubleshooting

### "Project not found" Error
- The project may have been deleted by another session
- Refresh the page and try again

### Form not clearing after submission
- This is normal for edit mode
- Use "Cancel" button to exit edit mode
- For new projects, form clears automatically on successful submission

### Changes not appearing immediately
- Try refreshing your browser
- Check browser console for any JavaScript errors
- Ensure your backend API is running and accessible

### Database Connection Issues
- In production, check DigitalOcean App Platform logs
- In development, ensure your backend server is running on port 5001
