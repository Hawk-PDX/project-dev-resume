# SPA redirect rules for React Router
# This file tells Render's static hosting to serve index.html for all routes
# that don't match static files, enabling client-side routing to work properly

# API routes should pass through to the backend (if any are served from this domain)
/api/* https://portfolio-backend-skva.onrender.com/api/:splat 200

# All other routes should serve index.html for client-side routing
