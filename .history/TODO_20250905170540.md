# Certificates Implementation Plan

## Overview
Implement a certificates section that displays certificates in cards, consistent with the existing project style.

## Tasks
- [ ] Create Certificate database model
- [ ] Add certificates backend route
- [ ] Add certificates API service
- [ ] Add useCertificates hook
- [ ] Complete CertificateCard component
- [ ] Create Certificates section component
- [ ] Update TODO.md

## Current Status
- CertificateCard.jsx exists but is mostly empty
- No backend support for certificates
- Need to follow existing section patterns (About, Skills, etc.)
