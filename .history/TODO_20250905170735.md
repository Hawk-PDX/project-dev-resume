# Certificates Implementation Plan

## Overview
Implement a certificates section that displays certificates in cards, consistent with the existing project style.

## Tasks
- [x] Create Certificate database model
- [x] Add certificates backend route
- [x] Add certificates API service
- [x] Add useCertificates hook
- [x] Complete CertificateCard component
- [x] Create Certificates section component
- [x] Update TODO.md

## Current Status
- CertificateCard.jsx exists but is mostly empty
- No backend support for certificates
- Need to follow existing section patterns (About, Skills, etc.)
