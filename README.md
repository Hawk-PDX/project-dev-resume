# Frontend dependencies
npm install

# Backend setup
cd backend
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**2. Environment Configuration**

Create `.env` in project root:
```bash
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5001/api
```

Create `backend/.env`:
```bash
FLASK_DEBUG=True
DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///portfolio_local.db
SECRET_KEY=your-development-secret-key
GITHUB_TOKEN=your_github_personal_access_token  # Optional but recommended
```

**3. Database Initialization**
```bash
cd backend
python -c "from run import app, db; app.app_context().push(); db.create_all(); print('Database initialized successfully!')"
```

**4. Development Servers**
```bash
# Terminal 1: Backend API (http://localhost:5001)
cd backend && source venv/bin/activate && python run.py

# Terminal 2: Frontend App (http://localhost:5173)
npm run dev
```

## Advanced Features

### GitHub Integration System
The portfolio includes sophisticated GitHub integration for streamlined project management:

**Multi-Account Support**
- Import projects from multiple GitHub accounts simultaneously
- Visual account attribution with clickable profile badges
- Smart repository filtering by stars, activity, and relevance

**Intelligent Data Extraction**
- Automatic technology stack detection from repository languages
- README parsing for project descriptions and live URLs
- Fork detection and repository metadata preservation

**Bulk Import Workflow**
1. Access the admin panel (development mode)
2. Use "Bulk Import" to specify multiple GitHub usernames
3. Review fetched repositories with sorting by popularity
4. Selectively import projects with full metadata

### Skills Management System
**Auto-Calculation Engine**
- Analyzes project technologies to determine skill proficiency
- Weighted scoring based on project complexity and usage frequency
- Manual override capability for specialized skills

**Smart Preservation Logic**
- Maintains manually set skill levels during auto-updates
- Conflict resolution between calculated and manual values
- Historical tracking of skill progression

### Admin Mode Architecture
**Environment-Based Control**
- Development mode: Full admin functionality enabled
- Production mode: Clean, read-only portfolio interface
- URL parameter override for demonstrations

**Granular Permissions**
- Feature-specific toggles (edit, delete, add, auto-calculate)
- Component-level visibility controls
- Safe data protection without authentication complexity

## Architecture Deep Dive

### Frontend Architecture
```
src/
├── components/        # Reusable UI components
├── hooks/            # Custom React hooks for data management
├── services/         # API communication layer
├── config/           # Environment and feature configuration
└── styles/           # Global styling and theme variables
```

### Backend Structure
```
backend/
├── app/
│   ├── models.py     # SQLAlchemy database models
│   ├── routes/       # API endpoint definitions
│   └── services/     # Business logic and external integrations
├── migrations/       # Database schema evolution
└── tests/           # Unit and integration tests
```

### Data Flow Pattern
1. React Components trigger user interactions
2. Custom Hooks manage state and API communication
3. Service Layer handles HTTP requests with retry logic
4. Flask Routes process requests and validate data
5. SQLAlchemy Models interact with PostgreSQL database
6. Real-time Updates refresh UI components automatically

## Deployment Strategy
